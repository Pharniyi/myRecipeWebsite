            <h3>Spaghetti with Meat Sauce</h3>
            <p>One-pot spaghetti puts Italian sausage, pasta sauce, and <br>noodles together for a dish you can have on the
            table in <br> less than 45 minutes. It doesn't get much easier than this <br> by cooking everything  in one pot. Switch it up
            by using <br>ground beef,chicken, or turkey along with any other of <br>your favorite ingredients, such as sliced mushrooms.
